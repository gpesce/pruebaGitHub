The service layer is there to provide logic to operate on the data sent to and from the DAO and the client. 
Very often these 2 pieces will be bundled together into the same module, and occasionally into the same code, 
but you'll still see them as distinct logical entities.
Another reason is security - If you provide a service layer that has no relation to the DB, then is it more difficult to 
gain access to the DB from the client except through the service. 
If the DB cannot be accessed directly from the client (and there is no trivial DAO module acting as the service) then all 
an attacker who has taken over the client can do is attempt to hack the service layer as well before he gets all but the 
most sanitized access to your data.
